scons and LaTeX Hello World.
============================

This is a minimal LaTeX project that uses scons as its build system.

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ensure that scons is installed on your system.
2. Ensure that latex is installed correctly on your system.

Building
~~~~~~~~

scons

(yes, it's that easy)

This will produce a file called hello-world.pdf that contains the end
result of the compilation.  There will be interim files too, but for
this simple example you don't care about them.

Cleaning
~~~~~~~~

scons -c

(yes, it's that easy)

This will remove all interim files from the source directory, leaving
only the source files and the build system files.

Actually there will be a hidden scons database, but we don't care
about it as it is a dot-prefixed filename that is normally not seen in
the directory listing.
